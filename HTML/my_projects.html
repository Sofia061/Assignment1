          One of my two freelance projects. This website consists of at least
          five fully developed pages and several interactive forms. It was built
          using WordPress with custom HTML and CSS coding to enhance layout,
          functionality, and design flexibility.

          My second freelance project. This website was a single-page project
          featuring a custom form and numerous interactive animations. It was
          developed using WordPress with extensive use of custom HTML and CSS
          for design and motion effects.<br /><br />

          Developed a fandom-style wiki website for GB ENTERTAINMENT, designed
          to present detailed information about the company and its artists. The
          project includes a visually engaging main page, along with some of
          individual artists' pages. The layout focuses on readability and easy
          navigation, reflecting the style of wiki platforms.

          Completed multiple courses at IT Step, where I gained hands-on
          experience by developing a wide range of projects, from small
          exercises to more complex applications. These projects spanned various
          programming languages and disciplines, including website and web
          application development, game design, and robotics.

          Developed last year as part of my coursework. This project involved
          creating a functional PHP application with a database backend,
          implementing CRUD operations, form validation, and dynamic content
          rendering.
